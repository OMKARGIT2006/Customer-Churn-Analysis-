Predicts customer churn using machine learning. Includes data cleaning, feature encoding, SMOTE for class balance, logistic regression modeling, and evaluation with accuracy, precision, and AUC. Visualizes churn distribution, feature importance, and ROC curve.


# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

Ever wonder why some customers leave while others stay? This project helps predict customer churn using machine learning. It takes a real-world dataset, cleans it up, builds a predictive model, and shows which factors matter most.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset includes details about 7,000+ telecom customers — like their service type, payment method, and whether they left or stayed.

## 🛠️ What I Did
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data (e.g., handled missing values, converted text to numbers)
- Balanced the dataset using **SMOTE** to deal with class imbalance
- Trained a **Logistic Regression** model
- Evaluated it using accuracy, classification report, and ROC curve
- Visualized churn distribution, key features, and model performance

## ✅ Results
- **Accuracy**: ~75%
- **AUC Score**: ~0.82
- Good performance in identifying churned customers

## 📈 Visuals
- Churn distribution by contract type
- Confusion matrix heatmap
- Top 10 important features
- ROC curve
